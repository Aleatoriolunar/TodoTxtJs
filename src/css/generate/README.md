Custom Colours
==============

Colour Definitions
------------------

Colour definitions are stored in *.json files.
To create a new one, start by copying & renaming
one of these files.

Valid values are any valid CSS colour:

* #aaaaaa
* rgb(123,13,123)
* blue

Generating CSS Files
--------------------

Use the powershell script in this folder to transform the definition files
into CSS files.

Generated files are named : simple\_definition-name.css

1. Ensure your working/current directory is the generate folder.
2. Run ./generate.ps1
3. Verify file in css folder.

Entirely New Styles
===================

To create an entirely new style, create your own copy of
simple_template.css.

If you stick to the same colour definitions as the simple_template.css then
your new layout will be able to re-use the existing definitions.
